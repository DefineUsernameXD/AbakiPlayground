Three pale, speckled pears sat on the sterile white counter. Their skin was a sickly yellowish-green, bruised with faint brown spots that seemed to pulse if you stared too long. They were the only things left of the triplets after the orchard's curse took hold. The brown stems weren't wood; they were the calcified remains of their tiny fingers, reaching out from the fruit that had consumed them. They ended up like this because they tasted the forbidden nectar of the Elder Tree, and now they wait, perfectly still, for someone to take a bite and join their silent, ripening family.
