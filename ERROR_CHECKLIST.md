# Quick Error Reference

This file provides a quick checklist of errors to find in `calculator.py`.

## Error Checklist

Find and fix these 6 errors:

- [ ] **Line 14:** Missing syntax character in function definition
- [ ] **Line 39:** Wrong function is being called for multiplication
- [ ] **Line 43:** Mathematical operation that will cause a crash
- [ ] **Line 47:** Arguments passed in wrong order
- [ ] **Line 51:** Variable used but never defined
- [ ] **Line 54:** Missing closing character in print statement

## Tips

1. Start by running the code - Python will tell you about syntax errors first
2. Once syntax errors are fixed, the code will run but may crash
3. After runtime errors are fixed, check if the output is correct
4. Compare your output with the expected output in README.md

## Difficulty Levels

- **Easy:** Lines 14, 54 (Syntax errors - Python tells you exactly where)
- **Medium:** Lines 43, 51 (Runtime errors - crashes with error message)
- **Hard:** Lines 39, 47 (Logic errors - code runs but gives wrong answer)

Good luck! 🍀
